This is an extension used to perform Duo Security two-factor authentication for
MediaWiki versions up to and including 1.26.

Quick Start:

1. Uncompress the DuoAuth tarball to the MediaWiki extensions directory.
2. Make sure that $wgServer is set in LocalSettings.php
3. If you are using a private wiki, make sure you whitelist the DuoAuth page:

# Append "Special:DuoAuth" to the $wgWhitelistRead array
$wgWhitelistRead = array("Special:DuoAuth");


4. Add the following settings to your LocalSettings.php file:

# setup of DuoAuth plugin
require_once( "$IP/extensions/DuoAuth/DuoAuth.php" );
$wgRedirectOnLogin = 'Special:DuoAuth';
$wgDuoIKey = '[The app's integration key]';
$wgDuoSKey = '[The app's secret key]';
$wgDuoHost = '[api-host].duosecurity.com';

Additionally, ensure that $wgSecretKey is at leat 40 characters. MediaWiki's
installer sets it to a 64-character random string by default.

Start up mediawiki and login.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Remember that this is only a means of authentication and does not take the
place of an authorization scheme. You need to setup your own authorization
scheme to fit your organization's needs using mechanisms that are outside of
this extension's functionality..

This extension does not handle any of the application configuration from the
Duo Security perspective. All application configurations must be configured
through the Duo Security administration web application.
